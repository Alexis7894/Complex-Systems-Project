# Complex-Systems-Project

PLease find on this page 2 R files corresponding to the two entries of my portfolio for the Complex-Systems Course.

These two assignments are presented and commented in the 'PORTFOLIO-Lombard.pdf' file.

In order to make it easier to reproduce my analysis, the folder "PreprocessedData" contains the .csv files corresponding to the epochs extracted for each of the selected
channels.

All informations regarding the OpenMiir dataset can be found at https://github.com/sstober/openmiir.

Best Regards,
Alexis Lombard.
